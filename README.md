## Seven-Step Approach to Solving Programming Problems

1. **Work an Example by Hand**
   - Solve a small instance of the problem manually.
   - Ensure you understand the problem and have the necessary domain knowledge.

2. **Write Down the Steps**
   - Document the step-by-step process you used to solve the problem by hand.
   - Be as detailed and precise as possible.

3. **Develop an Algorithm**
   - Generalize your solution to handle any instance of the problem.
   - Look for patterns and repetitive behaviors to devise the algorithm.

4. **Check the Algorithm**
   - Verify your algorithm with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.
   - Fix any mistakes before moving on to coding.

5. **Write the Code**
   - Translate your algorithm into the syntax of your chosen programming language.

6. **Run Test Cases**
   - Execute the code with various inputs to check if it produces the correct outputs.
   - Debug the program if it fails any test cases.

7. **Debug the Program**
   - Use the scientific method to identify and fix issues in your algorithm or code.
   - Revisit previous steps as needed to resolve problems.

This structured approach helps break down complex programming problems into manageable steps, ensuring a clear path from problem statement to working code.
